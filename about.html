                <p class="about-text-TLDR">TLDR; Crochet has helped me allieviate the stress and anxiety I often feel, even if I can only spare a few minutes at a time to work on it. Join me in quieting the mind while also making beautiful items.</p>

                <p class="about-text">Now for the rest of the story.</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">My mother taught me to knit and crochet before I was even old enough to read and write. She figured it would keep me busy while she worked on her own projects. I can't say my first project, a pair of pink slippers, was anything to write home about but I wore them proudly (so what if there were holes other than where the foot was supposed to go?). That feeling of accomplishment - I was hooked (so to speak)!</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">As I got older, especially after marrying and having two sons, I found I just did not have the time for it anymore. Life was crazy, between working a full-time job, taking care of a home, and of course taking care of children, not to mention about 1,000 other things that would come up each day (okay, maybe an exaggeration but it sure felt like it sometimes). It was often overwhelming. I started several projects but rarely completed them, and felt guilty at the growing number of bags with started items in the back of a closet.</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">Time passed and the pressures of life increased, I found myself suffering more and more from anxiety and depression. It wasn't until after my children were grown that I even thought about maybe doing something about it. I wish I had started therapy with a professional way sooner than I did. Please, please, if you find yourself with similar feelings, seek out professional help sooner rather than later.</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">One bit of advice I learned in therapy was that we all need time to focus on something that isn't a real (such as caring for aging parents) or imagined (anybody else worry about "what-ifs"? Just me?) problem. I learned some grounding exercises and other techniques to help me get out of my head, to silence the noise, even for just a few minutes. Sometimes I didn’t feel like I even had time for that, and would often deal with my stress through overeating. It was quick and it sure worked! That is until I felt the terrible guilt afterwards, not to mention the tight clothing. This “solution” only created more stress and anxiety. I absolutely needed a better alternative than food to rise out of a low moment.</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">It wasn’t until my children were grown and I semi-retired that I finally picked up my crochet hook again. Yep, I was pretty rusty, and the first project turned out terrible and it was all I could do to finish it. I didn’t feel proud of it. I was frustrated by many things, like not being great at finding the first and last stitch of a row, for example (please tell me I'm not the only one). What I did enjoy, though, was that my mind was quiet while I worked on it. I had to pay attention to where my next stitch was going and whether I had enough rows or needed to increase or decrease. Was it time to change color? And where does this new ball of yarn start?</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">I started to think about how I could elevate the joy of crochet while minimizing the frustrations. Fortunately, this is a very different world than the one I was in when I learned how to crochet. For one thing - YouTube! I wanted to improve my skills and there are so many smart and helpful creators out there. I don’t pretend to be as skilled as some of the folks you can find on there and other sources, but I feel so much more confident with my end results. Thanks to all the people who spend the time making these videos!</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">What I wasn’t great at was working on a complicated project that I really had to dedicate more time than ten minutes to each session. I found even after writing down where I was before putting the project down, I was lost for a little bit when I picked it back up again sometimes days later. I searched out simple projects and there are many out there, but then I started designing my own. I began writing them down and, voila, I was designing patterns! Most of what I create is suitable for beginners, but anyone at any level can enjoy making fun and beautiful projects that provide an escape from the chaos, even if only for a few minutes.</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">If any of this at all rings true for you, consider giving my patterns a try, especially if you are in a place in life where you don’t have a lot of time for crafts. Don’t be afraid if you’ve never crocheted before. I have and will continue to create videos to help you or you can surf the web and find other creators who work better for you. It helped me to give up on perfectionism. I think a mistake here and there adds to the character of a handmade piece, right?</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">If you made it this far, thank you for going the distance. Welcome to finding an easy and fun way to add a little joy or me-time into your life if that has been lacking lately. For my friends who have managed to achieve a great life balance solution, join in as well! You’ll have fun, too.  And share some of your tips for regaining calm with the rest of us!
