                <p class="about-text-TLDR">TL;DR: Feeling anxious and short on time? Crochet might be just the thing to relieve stress. It certainly helps me!</p>

                <p class="about-text">My love for crochet started before I could even read. My mom taught me early on, probably hoping to keep me busy while she worked on her projects. My first creation? A pair of pink slippers full of extra holes. I proudly wore them anyway. I was hooked!</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">As an adult, crochet fell to the bottom of my list. Between marriage, kids, work, and life’s endless <i>to-do</i> list, I barely had time to think, let alone crochet. I started projects but rarely finished them, and they added to my stress as they piled up in the back of my closet.</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">Eventually, anxiety and depression became bigger parts of my life. I wish I’d sought help sooner because therapy made a huge difference. Please don’t hesitate to seek help if you are struggling!  I learned we all need a break - something to focus on that isn’t a problem, real or imagined. For me, that escape turned out to be crochet.</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">When I picked up my hook again, I was rusty. My first project was a wonky mess, but the magic happened when I realized how quiet my mind became while I worked. Even a few minutes of crochet left me feeling calmer and ready for the rest of my day.</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">With the help of the internet (thank you, YouTube!), I brushed up on my skills. But I soon realized I needed quick, simple projects that I could work on in short bursts. That’s how I started designing my own patterns - easy and calming for people like me, who don’t have hours to spare.</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">My patterns are beginner-friendly but great for anyone needing a peaceful break. If you’re new to crochet, don’t worry. I have videos to guide you, and a few mistakes just add charm to your work.</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">So, if you’re looking for a little <i>me-time</i> or need to quiet the noise in your head, give my patterns a try. I hope you find as much joy and calm in crochet as I have.</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">Thanks for stopping by. Welcome to Calm Crochet by Andrea!</p>
